Declaration outline

The power of the economy to promote money is too confident in the combat effectiveness of businessmen. As a result, when the war is on the body, "greed is not good, but it is a good thing." Fighting with the enemy on the battlefield is land, wealth and power. Competing with competitors in the past is the customer's mind, sales volume and profit. The targets of the two may be different, but the strategies used in these two "battles" have something in common. Enterprise is the soul of the commander. Tactics are the beginning of the struggle.
Strategic Outline

    Art of War: The first is measure, the second is quantity, the third is number, the fourth is scale, and the fifth is victory. Earth-producing degree, degree-producing quantity, quantity-producing number, number-producing called, called Sheng-sheng. Therefore, victorious soldiers are called baht by yi, and defeated soldiers are called bah by baht. "

    Sun Tzu: "Knowing that my soldiers can be attacked, but not knowing that the enemy can't be attacked, is half of the victory; knowing that the enemy can be attacked, but not knowing that my soldiers can't be attacked, half of the victory; knowing the enemy's attackable, knowing my soldiers It can be attacked, but if you don’t know the terrain, you can’t fight, and you won’t be able to win. Therefore, it is said: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you will not be imperiled. If you know the heaven and the earth, the victory will be endless.”

    Military strength is investment, victory is profit, and everything is calculated with precision and rationality. Virtually every battle he fought took years of planning and preparation, while none of his opponents (and didn't have the time) to fully prepare.

    5s decisive business battle is: business knowledge, business strategy, business strategy, business skills, businessmen.

Although people are excited in their hearts, their opinions and beliefs are like compass needles on a ship tossing in a storm, pointing the way accurately.

The struggle between people consists of two distinct elements, hostile feelings and hostile intentions

When destroying the enemy's army, it is not just to destroy the enemy's material power, but more importantly, to destroy the enemy's mental power

**All wars are for customers, and the winners of all wars are those companies that successfully acquire customers. And all customers are people, and all people are being changed by the mobile Internet. Now, you still say war, is the voice very loud?

Stock index futures and stock price indices complement each other, are shadows of each other, and guide and restrict each other. The emergence of stock index futures will inevitably have a certain impact on the original laws and operating concepts of the stock market, and the investment professionalism of the stock market is further strengthened.
In the market, whenever there are new major changes, challenges and opportunities coexist, and a new reshuffle will occur in the investment team. A new batch of winners and losers will soon appear. I believe the lucky Those who are well-prepared in advance are those who are willing, and the losers are those who are overconfident or unresponsive. The conclusions are different. This directly affects whether to conduct follow-up investors and capital entry.

Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. "In fact, many people forget about history, they don't understand history at all. They always compare business to war, and those examples that have been over and over again. --- People can live on dreams for a period of time, but they won't last forever.

“In between the criss-crossing highways are gigantic business parks and humble three-bedroom, two-bathroom bungalows where the tallest buildings are the towers of electrical substations and the concrete poles that hold the telephone lines. The real jobs are the employees. They do it in a humble, small office separated by a screen, staring at the computer screen quietly. Everyone is trying to do something that no one has done before.

If you want to become a manager or a leader, there are three ways: 1. You have been in the company for a long time, and you have the qualifications to fight with your superiors and even company entrepreneurs. Going this road depends on luck, just follow the right person. 2. Concentrate on the technical details, delve into the technology, become a big cow, and turn into a leader. This is learning and excellence. 3. There is a relationship, and the family members serve in the relevant departments.

The road is long and life is short. "The most important thing is that you can't keep it in the world, Zhu Yan recites the mirror and the flower recites the tree." In the short life, choice is a major issue related to the value of life. No matter what book you read, what kind of person you are, what road you take, or what you do, some people think that the avenue is too difficult and too long to walk, and they always want to take a shortcut and take a shortcut. Therefore, life is often ingenious and opportunistic. What is the path to a real career success? It is called "Tian Dao Ji Qiao", "Heaven Dao Ji Ying", "Heaven Dao Ji Ying". It is because of the motivation of profit. Um. When there is benefit, people will choose to do good or bad. Human nature is neither good nor evil. Then why is there good and evil?

Don’t say anything about success, don’t remonstrate with success, don’t blame the past. Holding on to the past and "knowing how to do it" not only doesn't help the present, it also ruins the present.
